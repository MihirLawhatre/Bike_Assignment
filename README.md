## General Information
Bike sharing system is the system in which bikes were given to the customer for rides and the customer ride the bike for which the customer has to pay the amount.

The Bike Sharing company tied up with a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. The company want a model which
 will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 



## Conclusions
- Top three features that contributing significantly to explain the demand of bikes are
	- temperature 
	- Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
	- year
- R-Sqaured and adj R-Sqaured value of both train and test dataset well explains the demain of bikes by 83.4%
